    Submits an order to Alpaca and logs it to the database.

    SELLs are Limit Orders at the current price.

    Sell qty is floored to 8 decimal places before submission to prevent
    Alpaca's 'insufficient balance' rejection caused by float64 precision drift.
    Prices are sanitized via Decimal to prevent 'exceeds max precision' errors.

    After submission, fetches the filled order details from the exchange to
    record actual fill_price and fees, enabling accurate PnL tracking.

    avg_entry: the position's average entry price at the time of a SELL,
    used to compute and persist realized PnL (net of fees) for that closed
    position. Ignored for BUY orders; if omitted on a SELL, realized PnL is
    simply not recorded for that trade (rather than guessed).

    order_id_out: optional dict; on successful submission the exchange order
    id is written to order_id_out["order_id"] so callers can associate
    downstream logging (e.g. experience capture) with the real order.
