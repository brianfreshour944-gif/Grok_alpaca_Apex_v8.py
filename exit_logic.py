# exit_logic.py — Pure position-exit decision logic, extracted from
# main_bot.py's trading loop so it can be unit tested directly (no Alpaca
# client, no DB, no asyncio event loop needed to exercise it).
#
# This is exactly the code path that had the pnl_pct unit-mismatch bug
# (money.pct_change_x100(), formerly named safe_pct_change(), returns a
# percentage but was compared against a fractional stop_loss_pct) — it was
# untestable in isolation before this extraction, which is how that bug
# shipped across several "Fix ..." commits without being caught.

    Decides whether an open position should be exited this cycle.

    All *_pct arguments are fractions (0.03 == 3%), matching config.py's
    convention (BUY/SELL/PROFIT_TARGET/STOP_LOSS are all fractions there).
    pnl_pct is computed via money.pct_change_x100(), which returns a
    percentage already scaled by 100 -- it is divided back to a fraction
    here so it is directly comparable to stop_loss_pct/profit_target_pct
    and so displaying it as `pnl_pct * 100` gives the real percentage.

    Priority order (first match wins):
      1. Trailing stop (once price has run up past profit_target_pct from entry)
      2. Time-decay stop loss
      3. Max hold time
      4. Weak signal (only once min_hold_hours_before_signal has elapsed)

    Guards 2-4 are evaluated even when the trailing stop is armed but not
    triggered, so an armed trailing stop can no longer hold a stalled winner
    open past max_hold_hours (the trailing trigger is the only exit that
    takes precedence over them).
